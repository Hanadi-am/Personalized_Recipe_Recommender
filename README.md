# Personalized_Recipe_Recommender
Recipe recommendation system based on user’s input (ingredients, time to cook, &amp; nutritional information).
## Background
Food is the source of energy, having food high in nutritional value is important for the overall health. Being aware of the amount of nutrients in our food help us keep track of meeting our daily needs of energy and nutrients, thus maintaining our health. Time availability to cook varies from time to time, but that shouldn’t prevent us from having the same nutritious meals. For that, I wanted to create a Recommendation system that suggest a recipe based on user’s preference of main ingredient, time to cook, and nutritional information.
