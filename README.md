# Personalized_Recipe_Recommender
Recipe recommendation system based on user’s input (ingredients, time to cook, &amp; nutritional information).
## Background
Food is the source of energy, having food high in nutritional value is important to support the overall health. Being aware of the amount of nutrients in our food help us keep track of meeting our daily needs of energy and nutrients, thus maintaining our health. The availability of time to cook can vary from time to time, but that shouldn’t prevent us from having the same nutritious meals. For that, I wanted to create a Recommendation system that suggest a recipe based on user’s preference of main ingredients, time to cook, and nutritional information.
## Motivation
As someone who studied clinical nutrition and loves cooking, sometimes I don’t feel motivated to cook especially whenever I’m busy & don’t have enough time which sometimes reduces my diet quality. For that reason, I decided to create this recommendations system project that not only takes into account ingredients preference and nutritional value of the recipe but also the total time to cook to help me & everyone else to keep our diet quality despite of the time availability!
## Data
